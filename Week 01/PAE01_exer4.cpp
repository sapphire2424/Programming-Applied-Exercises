/* 2025年度 プログラミング応用演習 第1回 演習プログラム(4) - PAE01_exer4
====================================================================================================
■1周期のsin,cos値を求めるプログラム
・360ポイント（1度刻み）のsin,cos値を求める．
・角度[rad],sin値,cos値を，ファイル名 PAE01_exer4.csv で保存する．
・画面にも結果(数値)を表示する．
・保存したファイルをExcelで開き，sin,cosのグラフを作成して，ファイル名 PAE01_exer4.xlsx で保存する．
